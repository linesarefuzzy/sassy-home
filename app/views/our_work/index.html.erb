    <h2>The Carter Center</h2>
    <div class="blurb">
      <a href="http://cartercenter.org">The Carter Center</a> collects a tremendous amount of data during its election observation missions. We created ELMO, a web- and mobile-based system that allows observers to submit data using smartphones or tablets. Staff members at mission headquarters can then review the data and draw conclusions about the election. This technology places The Carter Center <a href="http://blog.cartercenter.org/2012/08/06/carter-center-on-leading-edge-of-technology-use-in-election-observation/">at the leading edge</a> of technology use in election observation.
