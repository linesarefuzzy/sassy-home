    We are a growing <a href="http://techworker.coop">worker-owned technology cooperative</a> specializing
    in web/app design and development for social justice orgs, non-profits, academics, artists, and others.
  </h1>

  <h2>We deeply understand technology.</h2>

  <div class="blurb">
    <p>Bringing years of expertise from industry, academia, and social justice organizing, we understand
    the values that are embedded in code and design. Our mission is to elicit these values to make beautiful,
    appropriate, and easy to use technologies. In particular, we are interested in work that promotes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> sharing and solidarity economies</li>
      <li> participatory democracies </li>
      <li> healthful living </li>
      <li> environmental justice and sustainability </li>
      <li> ending oppression at the intersections of gender, race, class, sexuality, and ability </li>
      <li> community and individual empowerment </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As our logo reflects, we are based in Michigan helping to bring life back into our home. <a href="http://sassfras.coop/Bylaws.odt"/>Read our bylaws here.</a></p>
